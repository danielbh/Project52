# Project52 Golang Challenge

This repo is an attempt at 52 Go Projects in 52 weeks. I'm doing this to gain experience in different domains that my day job does not cover. And for fun (Obviously)! I completely expect to fail. 

I've separated projects into different subdomains, those domains are:

* Distributed Systems
* Algos & DS
* Data intensive Applications
* Application Development
* Networking and Protocols
* Security

Inspired by [kkdai](https://github.com/kkdai/project52)

## The Rules

* Each project is due Sunday at noon each week.
* The project could be small or big, but it should be something new.
* Can use previous projects to build into larger projects
* Ideally all projects use golang.
* Don't need to create brand new project, you can rewrite some exist project.

## Projects

The following are planned projects that can change at anytime before they are complete.
